# Intro_to_Statistics_SP23
Welcome to my Intro to Statistics class repository! Here you will find code and materials from projects and assignments completed during the Intro course I took SP'23. This repository showcases my exploration into statistical concepts, data analysis techniques, and practical applications using tools such as Python, R, and Excel.

# **Contents:**

**Labs:** Completed statistical projects demonstrating data analysis techniques learned throughout the course.

**Assignments:** Homework assignments covering various statistical methods and their applications.

**Notes**: Personal notes summarizing key concepts, formulas, and methodologies studied in class.
Feel free to explore the code and projects to see how statistical principles are applied to real-world datasets. I hope this repository provides insight into my analytical skills and understanding of statistical methods gained from this course.
